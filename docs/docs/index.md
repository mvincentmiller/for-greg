# Bulu Gold Standard Site

Welcome to the Bulu Gold Standard documentation site. This is the place for semi-technical documentation on the setup, function, and operation of a Bulu Gold Standard website. Bulu Gold Standard is a collection of technology's that each have specific function that fulfill a certain role in the overall architecture.

As with most complex applications there are specific points in the application where Data flows from one part to another. Bulu Gold Standard will refer to these data flows as [Data Seams](images/dataSeams.jpg). Most of the application logic is focused on bridging Data Seams correctly. Likewise this documentation is built to reflect that and explain why some of these architecture decisions were made.

Currently Only a few sections of the Application is documented:
