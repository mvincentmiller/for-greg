# THINKING IN REACT

Coming from shopify themes and html you may be used to the concept of pages.
Those were the old days! Now we have a concept known as 'single page apps'.
Using the JavaScript library React, we can break parts of an app into 'components'.
For example, a Hero banner with copy, or a hero banner with a video player.
These components can be reused, mixed and matched.

When we decided to use react with Disney Backstage a lot of the previous limitations with Shopify where resolved. Now more than one developer could work on a site at a time. Developers could see their own changes update live from their machine without having to upload to a live or dev site. By leveraging the basic unit of organization known as a react component, developers now could use these building blocks over and over to build things like subscribe flows, checkout flows, and even simple popups.

Rather than start again with this new paradigm used for Disney, Gold Standard as a codebase allows us to flexibily resuse these building blocks for new accounts. Additionally, it allows us to close the loops on design cycles faster, better include stakeholders, and add value across the board.

custom integrations are limited only by the state of the art / web technology
